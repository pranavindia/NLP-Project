NLP Distributional Semantics Project
Project Overview
This project focuses on enhancing the preprocessing of text data to improve performance in natural language processing tasks. Various techniques are employed to process and analyze character dialogues from scripts, aiming to understand character interactions and linguistic similarities.

Preprocessing Techniques
Tokenization: Break text into words/tokens.
Cleaning: Remove punctuation and apply lowercasing.
Filtering: Eliminate stop words and apply spelling correction.
Normalization: Implement lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.
Feature Extraction
Use to_feature_vector_dictionary function to convert processed text into a string for further analysis.
Employ TfidfVectorizer to transform text into a frequency matrix.
Integrate POS tagging and sentiment analysis to enrich the feature set, creating a comprehensive representation of the data.
Data Structuring
Separate records are maintained for each character's spoken lines and contextual background.
A context window defines the proximity of lines considered relevant, ensuring the focus remains on the immediate dialogue environment.
Analysis
Perform grid searches to optimize cleaning methods and feature weighting, analyzing the impact on script line organization and information retrieval.
Assess character interactions based on linguistic similarities and differences, identifying closest and furthest matches in conversational styles.
Conclusions
Insights reveal patterns in character dialogue, influenced by shared experiences and narrative roles.
The project identifies challenges in mismatches due to narrative dynamics and tests configurations to refine the model's accuracy.
Future Directions
Propose further parameter tuning and expansion of the training dataset to accommodate a broader range of data and improve system robustness.
